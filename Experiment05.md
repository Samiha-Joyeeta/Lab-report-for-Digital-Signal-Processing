# Experiment No. 05
## Experiment Title: MATLAB Implementation of Z-transform of Causal, Anti-Causal and Non-Causal Signal.


## Theory:
The Z-transform is a mathematical tool that is used to convert the difference equations in time domain into the algebraic equations in z-domain. 
A causal signal is the type of signal that exists only in positive time. 
The anti-causal signal exists for only negative time while non-causal signal exits for both positive and negative time domain.


## Code:
Code of Z-transform of causal signal:
